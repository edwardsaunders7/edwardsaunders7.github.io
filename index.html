							<p><blockquote><strong>"To recognise the best Course Representative. Areas to consider: friendliness and openness, dedication in taking forward student feedback and resolving issues, prompt response to queries, updates course mates about meetings and outcomes of an issues taken forward."</strong></blockquote></p>
							<p><blockquote><strong>”Edward demonstrates all of the qualities I hope for in a course rep. He considers all of his classmates' positions equally and diligently reports them to the course team or SSCLG meetings. He responds to queries quickly and honestly, and is a fantastic liaison between the staff and students. Edward remains dedicated to his course even when he is going through difficult stages of his own studies, and for this he deserves recognition. His commitment to improving mental health in the university; alongside spearheading the campaign to improve budgets for student services. He has continued to work extremely hard to improve the students experience. Edward, I take my hat off to you sir.”</strong></blockquote></p>

				<!-- AboutMe -->
					<section class="wrapper style1  content-align-center invert imageAboutMe" id="AboutMe">
						<div class="inner">
							<h2  align=center>About Me</h2>
							<p align=center><strong>After reaching university I quickly realized that I love the process of exploring new ideas and concepts.
							To me learning is a constant feat of overcoming new challenges and improving my understanding of the universe around me. 
							Although my interests span into Quantum and Theoretical Physics, Philosophy, Psychology, and Computer Science, my main driver is an interest in the human cognition, and the consciousness that arises from it.
							</strong></p> 
							
							<p align=center><strong>I am a firm believer that knowledge is the forefront of innovation and development, I would love to study the defining features of the universe, and therefore how we experience and influence it as humans.
							I am always open to new ideas and perspectives, and try to participate in everything with the intent to better myself and those around me.
							This means that no matter the task I will always attempt to complete it to the best of my ability, I am not afraid of asking for help, nor am I afraid of not knowing what to do.
							</strong></p>
							
							
							
							<h2 align=center>Additional Interests</h2>
							<p align=center><strong>Having completed an A-Level in Computer Science I retain an interest in programming and technology.
							I would love to spend some time improving my Java abilities, as well as starting to learn Python, C++, and C#.
							The ability to write, and compile successful programs has always been a pleasure of mine, so finding a cause, or reason to further improve my abilities and create something useful would be an amazing opportunity.</strong></p>

							<p align=center><strong>Additionally, improving my language abilities is a goal of mine, as I believe becoming bi- or multi- lingual not only provides benefits in communication,
							but also helps to create a more diverse and healthy brain. Having studied Latin at GCSE level I have found it increasingly
							useful in day-to-day life, especially when it comes to breaking down and remembering the meaning behind medical 
							language found in my textbooks and lectures.</strong></p>

							<p align=center><strong>Alongside these, learning an instrument has been an interest of mine as it requires constant dedication and practice, 
							as well as improving fine motor Skills and coordination. Not only is music an influential medium that 
							can provide comfort, it’s use in Music Therapy for autistic children and the elderly provides an interesting outlet 
							into understanding it’s effects on our mental well-being.</strong></p>
							
							<h2 align=center>Hobbies</h2>
							<p align=center><strong>Although currently not playing, I have retained an interest in Ultimate Frisbee since my initial venture in the Reigate Grammar Ultimate Team,
							I have also found an interest in multiple Martial Arts such as Judo and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu,
							however have not been able to participate in these activities since joining University. Additionally I have dropped my hobbies 
							in Kayaking and Canoeing since joining University but would love to start back up again as time permits. Instead, I have recently picked up 
							Boxing at the University Gym, and joined a DnD (5e) group among friends; which has provided a surprising insight into creativity
							and imagination that I had not been aware of beforehand.</strong></p> 
							
							<p align =center><strong>Despite being new to Boxing it has already introduced me to new perspectives
							in focusing on the moment at hand, rather than trying to plan for every eventuality. In my third year I would like to undertake Rowing 
							and Rock Climbing as I believe both will not only provide a source of exercise, but provide their own unique experiences in teamwork,
							planning, and persistence in a challenging environment.</strong></p>
